A visually appealing website which shows a gallery of my drawings exploring the beauty and depth of the Black diaspora; from fashion, to sports, to music and even family. The website was developed using React (including their libraries for cool scrolling and transition features) and TailwindCSS.

### Introduction and about page
The main intention of this project was to combine the talents of front-end design and drawing. In the introduction of the page, I bring a visually appealing parallax scroll animation, minimalistic title features and smooth transitions to introduce the user.

### Gallery
The main aspect of the project: cool hybrid horizontal scrolling with a progress bar to track the current active image. The drawings show the comparison real-life pic as well as other details i.e. the name of the drawing, pronuncation etc.
